Modeling Spatio-Temporal Dependence of Cellular Traffic

This repository hosts the dataset and tools within our research paper
**"Analyzing and Modeling Spatio-Temporal Dependence of Cellular Traffic at
City Scale"**, <font color='red'>submission to ICC 2015</font>.

## Introduction

For the analysis of cellular traffic dependence over space and time, we perform
collections of this dataset in a developed city in East China.

Basic dimensions in this dataset are the space, time, and traffic statistics
(including bytes, packets). A complete week-long measurement is included
covering the most area of the city. The minimum spatial resolution of traffic
is the coverage area of individual cellular base station (around 200~500m), and
the minimum temporal resolution is one hour.

With acceptance of the data granularity, the user can theoretically recover the
topology of the cellular networks without definite geographic indications.

More information will be available soon when the paper is accepted by the
conference committee.
