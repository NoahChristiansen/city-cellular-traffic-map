{"name":"City Cellular Traffic Map","tagline":"Cellular Traffic, C2TM","body":"# City Cellular Traffic Map (C2TM)\r\n\r\nThis repository gives detailed description about\r\n[city-cellular-traffic-map dataset](https://github.com/caesar0301/city-cellular-traffic-map). You\r\ncan access the [CRAWDAD repository](http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu/sjtu/c2tm/) from Dartmouth to download the data\r\ndirectly. Please cite our paper below if this data contributes to you research\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nTraffic characteristics over space and time constitute an important aspect of\r\ncellular networks in consideration of resource provision, traffic engineering\r\nand system optimization. Despite recent progress in revealing temporal dynamics\r\nand spatial inhomogeneity of cellular traffic, limited knowledge about traffic\r\ndependence is gained. One of challenges comes from the absence of sustained\r\nobservations at a network-wide scale. To complement this gap, we make an\r\nanalysis on week-long traffic generated by a large population of people in a\r\nmedian-size city of China. Here we contribute the basic dimensions of this data\r\nto public communities to stimulate more research enthusiasm on this topic.\r\n\r\n## Data Collection and Preprocessing\r\n\r\nOur analyses make use of request-response records extracted from HTTP traffic\r\nat the city scale, consisting of individuals’ activities during a continuous\r\nweek (actually eight days from Aug. 19 to Aug. 26, 2012), with accurate\r\ntimestamp and location information indicated by connected cellular base\r\nstations (BS). Each individual is detected by the hashed International Mobile\r\nSubscriber Identity (IMSI).\r\n\r\nTo remain principle traffic characteristics and preserve user privacy from our\r\nanalysis simultaneously, we derive hourly statistics at base-station\r\ngranularity, which implies a maximum of N x M records (N the number of base\r\nstations, M the number of recording hours) in this public version. Meanwhile,\r\nunder requests of our data provider, the real location information of network\r\ninfrastructure is also meshed, whereas the relative topology of underlying\r\nnetwork is remained for study of network optimization or more.\r\n\r\n## Basic Dimensions\r\n\r\nThis public cellular traffic map contains two files, i.e., `traffic` and\r\n`topology`. The former provides hourly traffic statistics for each base\r\nstation, while the latter stores the relative topology of underlying cellular\r\nnetwork. The time dimension is represented by Gregorian calendar, with the\r\nstarting point of each hour to denote following 60 minutes (Note: GMT+8 time\r\nzone is assumed in the data). The relative location of base station is in\r\nlongitude/latitude form to facilitate some analysis with standard geographic\r\nprocessing about great circle distance.\r\n\r\n* Traffic trace file (1625680 rows, 5 columns)\r\n\r\n> * BS: identity of each cellular base station in this public data.\r\n> * Time_hour: hourly timestamp in UNIX epoch time (time zone GMT+8).\r\n> * Users: the number of active users associated with specific base station and hour.\r\n> * Packets: the number of transferd packets associated with specific base station and hour.\r\n> * Bytes: the number of transferd bytes associated with specific base station and hour.\r\n\r\n* Topology file (13296 rows, 3 columns)\r\n\r\n> * BS: identity of each cellular base station in this public data.\r\n> * Lon: relative longitude of given base station.\r\n> * Lat: relative latitude of given base station.\r\n\r\n## Visualization\r\n\r\nTo show basic dynamics of this data, we attach a heatmap animation (plotted by\r\n[R](http://www.r-project.org/)) below for the urban area of measured\r\nregion. The packets column in `traffic` file is used to estimate the traffic\r\ndensity over space, while a normalization over space and time dimensions is\r\ninvolved to show up the dynamics more obviously.\r\n\r\n![traffic_dynamic_heatmap](https://github.com/caesar0301/city-cellular-traffic-map/raw/master/heatmap_animation.gif)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can access the [CRAWDAD repository](#) from Dartmouth to download the data\r\ndirectly.
